## Pitches

### dead-villages: The communes that died for France
- Status: ✅ published
- Published URL: /stories/dead-villages/
- Source question: [Q-041](questions.md#q-041)
- Hook: Six French communes near Verdun have zero permanent inhabitants — erased in WWI and never rebuilt — yet they still hold official mayors and municipal councils over a century later.
- Data: INSEE Code Officiel Géographique 2023 (commune names, populations, coordinates) sourced from draft branch communes-index.json. 35,014 total communes analysed for metropolitan France distribution.
- Angle: Lead with the dead-village paradox → zoom into the Verdun six → explain the legal framework → contrast with France's smallest *inhabited* commune (Rochefourchat, pop=1) → show France's commune size distribution.
- Draft summary:
  > Six French communes near Verdun have had zero inhabitants since 1916 — but they still have mayors, hold council meetings, and appear in every census. France's response to its most devastating battle wasn't to erase the villages. It was to keep them forever on the books. 🇫🇷

### pharmacy-myth: The pharmacy myth (and what's actually weird about French pharmacies)
- Status: ✅ published
- Published URL: /stories/pharmacy-myth/
- Source question: [Q-007](questions.md#q-007-are-there-really-more-pharmacies-than-bakeries-in-france)
- Hook: The internet keeps saying France has more pharmacies than bakeries. It doesn't. But the *real* reason that myth feels true is more interesting — central Paris has roughly one pharmacy for every 700 residents.
- Data: National totals (~21K pharmacies vs ~35K bakeries) are well-cited externals. For commune-level density, IDF BPE data ([DS-001](datasets.md#ds-001), [DS-002](datasets.md#ds-002)) gives 1,300 communes with both counts side by side. National coverage requires SIRENE parquet ([DS-003](datasets.md#ds-003)) — out of scope for v1, but a clear follow-up.
- Angle:
  1. Lead with the myth-busting: a simple bar showing 35K vs 21K nationally.
  2. Pivot: "But here's why the myth feels true" — switch to per-capita density. Paris 8e at 14 pharmacies per 10k is the headline.
  3. Reveal the deeper pattern: scatter of pharmacies vs bakeries across all IDF communes, with the Paris arrondissements highlighted. The fitted line shows they move in lockstep — this is a commercial-density story, not a bread-or-medicine story.
  4. Close on the EU comparison (France leads Europe in pharmacy density per capita, by a wide margin).
- Confidence: high on the structural pattern (the IDF BPE data is from INSEE, and the population-relative density pattern is durable). Medium on absolute counts since BPE counts are circa 2014.
- Cadence: not time-sensitive. Evergreen story.
- Draft X summary:
  > "More pharmacies than bakeries" is one of those facts about France that everyone repeats and almost no one checks. Today on **france-data**: the actual numbers, why people get them wrong, and the one Paris neighbourhood with a pharmacy for every 712 residents. 🇫🇷
- X summary (final):
